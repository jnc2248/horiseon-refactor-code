## **Description**

The Horiseon website's codebase has been refactored to meet accessibility standards. The website has now been optimized for search engines. Semantic HTML elements and alternate text for images have been added to the source code, and it has been made to follow a logical structure.

## **Usage**

Enter the website's URL into browser. Topics can be found at the top right. Press any of these to be linked to a different part of the webpage with more information about the selected topic. There is also a sidebar with additional information on right side, towards the bottom of the page.
